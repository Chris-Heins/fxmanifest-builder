# fxmanifest-builder
fxmanifest-builder  fxmanifest-builder is a small Windows-friendly Python tool that auto-generates fxmanifest.lua files for FiveM resources. Drag in any car, map/MLO, script, clothing/stream, or NUI resource and it will scan the files and output a clean, “real-looking” fxmanifest.lua with correct sections and data_file lines.
